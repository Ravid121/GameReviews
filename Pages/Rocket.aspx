    <h3 style="text-align:left">
        <br />Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix.
        <br />he game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch being released later on.
        <br />In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner Bros.
        <br />Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of 2017.
        <br />Versions for macOS and Linux were also released in 2016, but support for their online services was dropped in 2020.
        <br />The game went free-to-play in September 2020.
        <br />
        <br />Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams
        <br />using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match.
        <br />The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions.
        <br /> Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.
