        <br />MultiVersus is a platform fighter, similar to the Super Smash Bros series.
        <br />in which players battle on different stages and attempt to knock their opponents outside the boundaries of the arena,
        <br /> with characters being knocked further the more damage they take
        <br />The game is primarily played in a 2-vs-2 format, though 1-vs-1 and free-for-all options are available.
        <br />The game features a perk system, which allows players to customize their characters with equippable passive abilities that will also effect their partners in 2-vs-2.
        <br />There are "Signature Perks", which are special passives that directly affects the respective character's attributes and/or abilities.
        <br />If players in the same team equip the same perks, they will get a perk synergy, which increases the effects of said perks.
