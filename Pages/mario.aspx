    <h3 style="text-align:left">
        <br />Super Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo starring their mascot, Mario.
        <br />Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario series, it is the central series of the greater Mario franchise.
        <br />At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console.
        <br />There are more than 20 games in the series.
        <br />The Super Mario games are set primarily in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, typically with Mario as the player character.
        <br /> He is usually joined by his brother, Luigi, and often by other members of the Mario cast.
        <br /> As platform games, they involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels.
        <br />The games have simple plots, typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser.
        <br />The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the series' core gameplay concepts and elements.
        <br />These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give the character special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing.
