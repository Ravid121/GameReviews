        <br />Overwatch 2 is a 2022 first-person shooter by Blizzard Entertainment. As a sequel to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch
        <br />the game intends a shared environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while introducing persistent cooperative modes
        <br />A major change in PvP modes was to reduce team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked.
        <br />Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4 and features full cross-platform play.
        <br />
        <br />Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a "hero" from a roster of 35 characters.
        <br /> Characters are organized into a "damage" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a "support" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a "tank" class, responsible for the team's protection.
        <br />Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and ultimate abilities. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP)
        <br />combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.
